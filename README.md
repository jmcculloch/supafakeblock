# Supafakeblock

![build](https://github.com/jmcculloch/supafakeblock/workflows/build/badge.svg)

Supafakeblock is composed of a distributed blacklist and a browser extension that augments Facebook group content.

A blacklist of malicious accounts is stored on [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) using [rxdb-supabase](https://github.com/marceljuenemann/rxdb-supabase). A local copy of the blacklist is synchronized at extension intialization. Profile queries occurs against this local copy and are not separate remote network calls.

The browser extension will montitor Facebook group content including:
* Group posts, comments, member lists
* Group admin activities, e.g. participation requests
* Any group content in your personal feed

and highlights blacklisted profiles. Unknown group profile links will have an icon to report the profile to the distributed blacklist. The UI is rudementary and will change over time.

Only Google Chrome is supported but Firefox, Safari, etc could be supported in the future. If there is enough interest I will give this some attention.
